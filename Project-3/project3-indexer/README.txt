FROM CHO'S README:
This example contains a simple utility class to simplify opening database
connections in Java applications, such as the one you will write to build
your Lucene index. 

To build and run the sample code, use the "run" ant target inside
the directory with build.xml by typing "ant run".

====================================================================================

In order to support the basic keyword search function described before, 
you will first need to create a Lucene index on a number of attributes of your database tables.

Decide which index(es) to create on which attribute(s). 
Document your design choices and briefly discuss why you've chosen to create your 
particular index(es) in a plaintext file called README.txt.
